## About Us

According to GitHub’s “State of the Octoverse” report 2019, **99%** of software projects in the world use Open Source Technologies in some way or the other. Open source has undoubtably changed the world, and we, the JODC *(JIIT Open-Source Developers Circle)* aim to help students to become a part of it.

The JODC is an initiative by the students of JIIT-128 to promote open source culture. The hub is all about contributing to and collaborating on projects, networking, learning together and guiding students.

We conduct talks, workshops, activities, one-to-one sessions and dev-sprints to mentor students. We encourage them to volunteer for open source projects and organisations and participate in open source initiatives such as Google Summer of Code and Outreachy to become better developers and for the betterment of open source.

## Team structure since the 2020-2021 session:

1) The society will run on the disciplined collaboration between volunteers and coordinators.
2) Volunteers are the students who are into the second or first year of their engineering.
3) Coordinators are the students who are into the 3rd year of their engineering. The promotion of students from Volunteer to the post of Coordinator will be based on their performance. A coordinator without having the experience as a volunteer will be selected only in very special cases.
4) There will be 3 head positions:
   * Society Head / Head Coordinator
   * Technical Head
   * Management Head
  
   Technical and Management Head will report to Society Head.
   __To apply for any of the Head position, one needs to be a volunteer in their previous academic session.__ 

It is an ideal system to introduce new students to responsibilities and prepare them to carry on the legacy. The form for every positions will be released yearly and will be informed accordingly.
